# RealmBinary (Swift Package)

Consume Realm and RealmSwift as prebuilt XCFramework binaries via Swift Package Manager.
This avoids compiling Realm from source in Debug builds and keeps your app snappy.

Contents
•	Realm.xcframework (Core)
•	RealmSwift.xcframework (Swift API)

You can use either the remote (URL + checksum) setup or local (path) setup.
